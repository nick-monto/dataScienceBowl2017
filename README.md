# Data Science Bowl 2017

Repository holding my work for the 2017 Kaggle Bowl. The data files for this years competition are DICOM files.
The current preprocessing code is very minimal and borrows from Guido Zuidhof's preprocessing tutorial.
I have added code to make the script fully automated, given the proper directory configuration:

./Input/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample_training_images/    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This will be the training folder*   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paitent ID/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DICOM files  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paitent ID/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DICOM files  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc...

Files will be uploaded as they reach milestones in completion, starting with the initial preprocessing code.

These scripts have been written and tested in python 3.5.2
